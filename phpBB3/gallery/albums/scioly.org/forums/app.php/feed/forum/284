I used it in my computer architecture class to help simulate complicated circuits, including registers, adders, and pipelined MIPS processors. In the beginning of the course, we used it to develop simple logic circuits to help familiarize with the language. Obviously, for the scope of Circuit Lab, you aren't going to be tested on computer architecture circuits, but simply just basic logic.<br><br>The language itself is pretty easy to learn. I'd say that the only downside is the <a href="https://iverilog.fandom.com/wiki/Installation_Guide" class="postlink">installation process</a> which might seem a bit complicated. Also, the program works best on Unix. (Installing it on Windows is kind of a pain, so I'd recommend you to get and setup the <a href="https://microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" class="postlink">Ubuntu client for Windows</a> and then following the Unix/Linux instructions if you want to install iVerilog. MacOS is built on top of Unix, so it's less of a pain.) Another hurdle some people might have is that this is a command line program, meaning the Verilog code must be complied and run using commands. I feel this is more of a learning curve as commands can found through some Google searches, but some people might not want to go through the hassle.<br><br>Again, Verilog is something that isn't necessary to have to evaluate these types of circuits, as it is really meant to evaluate registers and other computer circuits. I just wanted to put it out there, because you never know where it might come in handy for.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=36547">Nydauron</a> — July 21st, 2020, 1:21 am</p><hr />

There will also often be questions on boolean algebra in the same section as digital logic questions.

<blockquote class="uncited"><div>I had a question regarding electron volts. What are the corresponding formulas for finding eV per photon, work function, and velocity of the electrons? How many questions regarding this should I expect on the test?</div></blockquote>An electron-volt is a unit of energy; it's just an electron charge (<em class="text-italics">e</em>) multiplied by one volt (V), which gives the unit a nice memorable abbreviation of eV. In SI Units, the electron charge is 1.60 × 10<sup>−19</sup> coulombs, so 1 eV = <span style="font-size:130%;line-height:116%">(</span>1.60 × 10<sup>−19</sup> C<span style="font-size:130%;line-height:116%">)</span>(1 V) = 1.60 × 10<sup>−19</sup> C·V, which is also the same in joules because C·V = J.<br><br>You can find the energy of a single photon by <em class="text-italics">E</em> = <em class="text-italics">hf</em>, where <em class="text-italics">f</em> is the photon's frequency and <em class="text-italics">h</em> is Planck's constant. The work function is the amount of energy needed for a photon to make current start to flow in a material—it differs from material to material, but if you're given a graph or some data, you'd look at what amount of energy per photon would cause current to go from zero to a nonzero number.<br><br>An electron's kinetic energy is <img style="vertical-align:middle" src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?\text{\scriptsize $K = \frac12mv^2$}"><!--&lt;img src="http://www.forkosh.com/mathtex.cgi?{TEXT}" alt="{TEXT}" border=0 align="middle"&gt;-->, so once you know it's kinetic energy, you know it's velocity. It's a lot easier said than done because most of the time, you don't really know the kinetic energy of any individual electron. However, if your test asks about a photoelectric experiment, you can calculate the <em class="text-italics">maximum</em> speed of electrons through <em class="text-italics">K</em> = −Δ<em class="text-italics">U</em> = <em class="text-italics">e</em><em class="text-italics">V</em><sub>stop</sub>, where <em class="text-italics">e</em> is the electron charge again. (Sorry if this is confusing; if so, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/quantum-physics/photons/a/photoelectric-effect" class="postlink">reading about the photoelectric effect</a> may give you a bit more background on where these equations come from.)<br><br>Because different test writers are in charge at different tournaments, it's entirely possible that that these topics come up at one tournament, but not another. I don't think I saw electron energy on tests very often back when I was in high school, but it always helps to learn more. Good luck! :<span style="font-size:85%;line-height:116%"></span>)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47584">gz839918</a> — July 7th, 2020, 1:39 pm</p><hr />
