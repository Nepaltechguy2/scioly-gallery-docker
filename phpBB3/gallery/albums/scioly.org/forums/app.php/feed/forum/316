I would say that it depends. Each tournament has potential to run differently (the list of potential tournament models, as well as the SOInc page explaining them is <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=334&amp;t=17996" class="postlink">here</a>). Obviously, the in-person model, if it is able to happen, will (probably) hold build events. The Satellite SO model will run events online, but a team will run events in their school. This model is also likely to hold build events, given that the tournament is willing to coordinate the challenge that running the builds may provide. It is highly likely that if a state (and probably a regional) competition runs Satellite, they would also run builds. The last tournament style is mini SO, where all events will be run from a person's house, and build events and lab events were cancelled for safety concerns. <br><br>So, I would think that it would still be worth it to continue builds, especially if your schools are open, as it is likely that you will be seeing at least one tournament in 2021 holding build events.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=63182">RiverWalker88</a> — July 20th, 2020, 3:24 pm</p><hr />

Hey everyone!<br><br>I hope you're doing well and staying safe during these unprecedented times. I heard about how building events would be canceled for the upcoming season. I also got wood a few days ago as well to prepare for next season. Is it worth it to continue building for next season or should I return my wood? Is there even a chance for building events to return for next season?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54073">dankdecidueye</a> — July 20th, 2020, 2:12 pm</p><hr />

<blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi Boomilever people, <br><br>So I need some advice on attaching verticals. I don’t know whether to use bass or balsa, or how to get them on properly because of the annoying angles of the compression and tension pieces. My breaks this season have mostly been compression explosions because they bend upwards. Any tips on how to do this? I just want to do one vertical on each side of the boomi so I can shrink the size of my compression to save mass. So far I’ve just made the main supports of my compression so tall and thick to the point where verticals aren’t needed, but with that comes the fact that the compression is so. heavy. Which is not cool efficiency wise. <br>My next steps to make my boomi lighter is 1. Learn how to properly do verticals so I can shrink my compression and 2. Change my bass size from 1/8x1/16 to either 1/8x1/32 or 3/16x1/32 for tension. I have experimented taking off lamination at either the hook area (I use a dowel) or the distal end, but that very experimenting told me that that excessive lamination, although mass consuming, is not optional, so I’m not going to mess around with lamination. I’d rather have a compression break than a lamination/dowel break for sure. <br><br>My peak efficiency this year was a 1.7k but the highest I’ve gotten at competition is 1.5k, because I’ve been too scared to go to light because I don’t want to lose the bonus. UPenn efficiencies were scary good. So I need something to save lots of mass for NYS. My guess is around 1.3k for top ten, but I have NO idea of the competitiveness of the top 5.</div></blockquote><br>A few things to consider here.
