Thanks to everyone who participated! We had 35 participants from 19 different states compete in the scrimmage.<br><br>The test, key, and solutions can be found here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11-CMxKKWiSjrZjiAIYmBnCo7-cXcti5O?usp=sharing" class="postlink">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/ ... sp=sharing</a> (Note that Question #10 was changed midway through the test, but the errors and quote itself were kept very similar).<br><br>Grading was challenging - some people incorrectly input their results ("from from" instead of "come from" in the timed question, for example). In these sorts of scenarios, I counted the answer that was shown in the pictures taken only if you had clear work shown. All results were manually graded (and not with google sheet regex formulas). <br><br><strong class="text-strong">Results:</strong><br><em class="text-italics">(Place: Name)</em><br>1st: Umaroth<br>2nd: A.

The prize is a Science Olympiad water bottle + 2 Codebusters stickers. The stickers were generously provided by astropanda2004's Redbubble shop. Congratulations to both Umaroth and A. Cai!<br><br>All people who filled out the feedback form were also entered into a prize pool - the winner of the random drawing is <strong class="text-strong">Aimer</strong>.

If you’ve been paying attention to the news, you’re probably wondering what Scioly.org has anything to do with this. The truth is closer than we may think.<br><br>Racism remains very much alive today. Policies that once discriminated against “African Americans” have been scribbled out, and replaced with policies targeting “criminals,” “the needy,” “uneducated Americans,” or “high-risk individuals.” Racism lives inside systems: within laws, businesses, and schools, it tears at the heart of black communities, <em class="text-italics">even in the absence of racist people</em>. Often, this racism hides beneath the surface, but recent events show that the monster is very real.<br><br>In light of the tragedies of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Mike Ramos, and countless others, Scioly.org stands in solidarity with the black community. We support their movements to peacefully grieve and protest violence, oppression, racism, and police brutality. We recognize our responsibility to speak against discrimination and condemn all forms of racism, including the racism living within systems themselves.<br><br>We’ll be honest though: we realize science struggles with diversity and inclusion. America’s segregated school system lets the best schools serve a select suburban elite, while other more diverse schools go chronically underfunded—a system where the privilege of experiencing science and Science Olympiad belongs to only a few. Science Olympiad is near and dear to the hearts of oh-so many of us, but sadly, the truth remains that black students face formidable challenges to entering science.<br><br>That’s where you come in. Yes, <strong class="text-strong">you</strong> can help! Being anti-racist needs commitment: it’s not about whose Instagram has the darkest black square, nor is it about who has the most black friends. We pledge to actively uphold a lifelong commitment to learning, unlearning, empathizing, and advocating on behalf of the black community. We will read books, watch films, and teach ourselves about racism. <a href="http://bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES" class="postlink">Here are some anti-racism resources we suggest</a>. We’ve also started a thread where you can <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=335&amp;t=17990" class="postlink">discuss these topics</a> in more detail.<br><br>After all, that’s why we do science. Science is about progress—and about people.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47584">gz839918</a> — June 19th, 2020, 4:05 pm</p><hr />

Hi everyone!<br><br>Hope you all are doing well in this crazy pandemic - especially on AP/IB exams! Those of us who have already graduated from high school can't even imagine what doing those at this time would be like, so hats off to all of you in your endeavors and how you all are just killin' it! <br><br>We, the staff, would love to celebrate your achievements with a game night over Zoom after all exams have been completed! There will definitely be Jackbox Games (spanning all six party packs) and skribbl.io, but we will definitely be open to many other forms of online party games as well! Anyone is invited!<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Party Date and Time: May 29th, 2020, starting at 9 p.m. EST (6 p.m. PST)</strong> and there will be no definitive end time - everyone who attends is free to play games for as long as they want!<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Where:</strong> Use the chat function in the navigation bar above to join the Scioly.org IRC channel around the specified time, and the link to the Zoom call will be posted there at that time (You will not need an account to get into IRC!
