Hey guys! I found this cool website that I thought the SciOly community would enjoy. If you've ever wanted to talk to a scientist, now's your chance. If you are a school group, family, or class, you can sign up to skype with a scientist and have a discussion about your topic of choice, depending on what scientist you choose to talk to. This is a Q&amp;A, not a lecture, so this is a great way to get to know more about what scientists do. Link to the website is here: <a href="https://www.skypeascientist.com/" class="postlink">https://www.skypeascientist.com/</a><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=17691">lumosityfan</a> — August 4th, 2020, 7:44 am — Replies 0 — Views 65</p><hr />

Welcome back again! Might as well get another one of these going. For previous games, see<br><a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=18073" class="postlink">#8</a>, <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=13124" class="postlink">#7</a>, <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=12624" class="postlink">#6</a>, <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=12115" class="postlink">#5</a>,  <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=11449" class="postlink">#4</a>, <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=11063" class="postlink">#3</a>, <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=11012" class="postlink">#2</a>, and <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=10779" class="postlink">#1</a>.<br><br>The Rules:<br>1. You have 10 questions that you try to guess a correct answer for.<br>2. The catch is that the goal is to get the fewest number of points. The way you earn points is for each correct answer you give, you will earn the number of points equal to the number of people who guessed that answer. So, for instance, if your answer to Question 1 is Thomas Jefferson and 3 other people guessed that answer, you would earn 4 points for that question (1 for yours and 3 for the others). If you get the answer wrong, you earn the number of points equal to the number of participants plus 5 points (i.e. if there are 13 participants, you get 18 points). The best attainable score is 10 points.<br>3. There are two bonuses you could use to replace an answer: DROP and SHEEP. DROP means you earn 1 point for that question. SHEEP means you earn the number of points equal to the answer that the most people answered. So for instance, if the correct answers were A, B, C, and D, and 7 people guessed A, 6 people guessed B, 3 people guessed C, and 2 people guessed D, then the people who said SHEEP would earn 7 points for the answer (your SHEEP doesn't count as an answer and doesn't affect the others' scores). You get only 1 of each bonus if you so choose to use them. It is advised that you use DROP before SHEEP. Again, you don't have to use<br>4. PM me your responses by Tuesday, 11 August, 11:00 CDT. Any answers PMed after that point will not be considered.<br>5. Make sure not to cheat, please. Cheating is defined as letting other users know what your answers are before the deadline is reached. For this game, <strong class="text-strong">you may use any sources to find your answers</strong> (i.e. the wiki, Google, etc.).<br>6. Users can change their answers before the due date arrives, but after the due date, answers may not be changed.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=36820">HugoTroop</a> — July 27th, 2020, 11:55 pm — Replies 3 — Views 193</p><hr />

I'll preface this by saying that we need volunteers for this event! If you are interested, please see the section at the end of this post, as <span style="text-decoration:underline">we need volunteers to be test writers, test graders, event supervisors, and potential region proctors.</span> Not only is this Yosemite Invitational's first year, but it is the first ever digital Scioly tournament! All events will run according to miniSO rules, meaning Boomilever, Detector Building, Experimental Design, Gravity Vehicle, Ping Pong Parachute, Wright Stuff, and Write It Do It may not be held. <strong class="text-strong">However, there is still a chance we will run build events, which is clarified in a section of this post.</strong><br><br>Please visit our website for more information, to join our mailing list, and to volunteer to compete: <a href="https://yosemitescienceoly.wixsite.com/yosemiteso" class="postlink">https://yosemitescienceoly.wixsite.com/yosemiteso</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">How will the tournament run?</strong></span><br><br>The tournament will run from the 12th-16th of December. That's right, this is a multi-day tournament. All events that are exam-heavy will be run with only exams in an online format. This means all events save those mentioned above will be run with the test component only, though it is at the test writer's discretion to add a dry lab component to their exam. Digital testing will run on the 14th and 15th of December, with half of the events happening on the 14th and the other on the 15th. This will happen through an online platform like zoom or another platform optimized for SO that I'm told is in development. The awards ceremony is on the 16th. If conditions permit, build events will run on the 12th and 13th according to guidelines laid out in the next section.<br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">What about build events?</strong></span><br><br>Build events will run on the 12th/13th of December if students are able to meet and practice for these events. Half of the teams would compete on the 12th, with the other half competing on the 13th. Conditions permitting, competing teams would designate a location at which volunteers can proctor them, most likely their school site or other location where they practice. Proctors will run all events listed above with times that are listed on the event schedule on our website. If this isn't possible a coach may proctor the event so long as supervisors from the tournament are able to watch all runs live. In either case no centralized tournament site is needed for the safety of our competitors. Teams would be responsible for providing the testing apparatuses for Boomilever and Ping Pong Parachute. Given different team's resources will vary, some build events may not be counted for the overall score (such as Boomilever if not all schools can secure a testing device). Ping Pong Parachute will not be counted for overall scoring per last year's guidelines for CA-based tournaments. <strong class="text-strong">Given the current order by Governor Newsom for schools to mostly remain closed, it is unlikely that build events will run, but we remain optimistic nonetheless.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">How can teams register?</strong></span><br><br>This tournament has been approved by the NorCal State Director, but teams are not yet able to register via Scilympiad. No more than two teams per school will be able to compete, with no more than 25-30 teams able to enter. NorCal teams with a state bid will be prioritized. Costs will be lower than most tournaments given that it is online. We will let everyone know as soon as we know when registration opens. Join our mailing list here for competition-related updates: <a href="http://eepurl.com/g_izqr" class="postlink">http://eepurl.com/g_izqr</a><br><br><span style="text-decoration:underline"><strong class="text-strong">How can I volunteer?</strong></span><br><br>We really need your help! It is going to take a lot to put this tournament on, especially with only 4.5 months to plan. But with confidence and your strong support we'll be able to make a little bit of history and give students the chance to compete again! We are in need of digital event supervisors, prospective in-person proctors, and test writers and graders.

If you can't, then spread the word.

Our team will be competing at Foo Invy at Bar date, check us out!")</li></ul>The goals of this platform are to be:<ul><li>Fast, easy, and simple onboarding</li></ul><ul><li>Drop-in or side-by-side replacement</li> </ul><ul><li>Both simple (profile or posts only) and complex view (results, team history)</li></ul>Any comments/advice?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=62488">aidenybai</a> — July 22nd, 2020, 9:05 am — Replies 8 — Views 364</p><hr />

Hey everyone!<br><br>I hope you're doing well and staying safe during these unprecedented times. I heard about how building events would be canceled for the upcoming season. I also got wood a few days ago as well to prepare for next season. Is it worth it to continue building for next season or should I return my wood? Is there even a chance for building events to return for next season?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=54073">dankdecidueye</a> — July 20th, 2020, 2:12 pm — Replies 1 — Views 273</p><hr />

<sup>Note: I got permission from the moderators to post this</sup><br><br>Hey everyone! If you’re like me, you probably got a <em class="text-italics">very</em> unsatisfying end to Science Olympiad this year. This problem was mirrored across almost every other science competition as well. I don’t think our studying should go to waste however, so me and some friends are hosting an online team science competition, called <strong class="text-strong">Quarantine Science Tournament 2</strong>!<br><br>We’re constantly expanding, the first tournament was Indiana-only, but this tournament will be open to participants anywhere in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States" class="postlink">Midwest</a>. Since this is our second time, we know how to run things smoothly so you’ll be guaranteed a great experience!<br><br>You will be in self-made teams of 5 (or you can register with a smaller amount of people, and we’ll add people to your team), and feel free to send as many teams per school as you want (or even join with people from other schools, anything's cool). The competition itself will have multiple game types, to ensure people from all competitions have a good chance, and to make it more fun. And finally, thanks to our sponsors, we have PRIZES!<br><br>Learn more and register at: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ihssc/home" class="postlink">https://sites.google.com/view/ihssc/home</a><br><br>If you have any questions, feel free to PM me or leave a reply in this topic. Hope to see you all there!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=38237">l0lit</a> — July 16th, 2020, 7:58 pm — Replies 2 — Views 491</p><hr />
