If you’ve been paying attention to the news, you’re probably wondering what Scioly.org has anything to do with this. The truth is closer than we may think.<br><br>Racism remains very much alive today. Policies that once discriminated against “African Americans” have been scribbled out, and replaced with policies targeting “criminals,” “the needy,” “uneducated Americans,” or “high-risk individuals.” Racism lives inside systems: within laws, businesses, and schools, it tears at the heart of black communities, <em class="text-italics">even in the absence of racist people</em>. Often, this racism hides beneath the surface, but recent events show that the monster is very real.<br><br>In light of the tragedies of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Mike Ramos, and countless others, Scioly.org stands in solidarity with the black community. We support their movements to peacefully grieve and protest violence, oppression, racism, and police brutality. We recognize our responsibility to speak against discrimination and condemn all forms of racism, including the racism living within systems themselves.<br><br>We’ll be honest though: we realize science struggles with diversity and inclusion. America’s segregated school system lets the best schools serve a select suburban elite, while other more diverse schools go chronically underfunded—a system where the privilege of experiencing science and Science Olympiad belongs to only a few. Science Olympiad is near and dear to the hearts of oh-so many of us, but sadly, the truth remains that black students face formidable challenges to entering science.<br><br>That’s where you come in. Yes, <strong class="text-strong">you</strong> can help! Being anti-racist needs commitment: it’s not about whose Instagram has the darkest black square, nor is it about who has the most black friends. We pledge to actively uphold a lifelong commitment to learning, unlearning, empathizing, and advocating on behalf of the black community. We will read books, watch films, and teach ourselves about racism. <a href="http://bit.ly/ANTIRACISMRESOURCES" class="postlink">Here are some anti-racism resources we suggest</a>. We’ve also started a thread where you can <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=335&amp;t=17990" class="postlink">discuss these topics</a> in more detail.<br><br>After all, that’s why we do science. Science is about progress—and about people.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=47584">gz839918</a> — June 19th, 2020, 4:05 pm — Replies 0 — Views 8220</p><hr />

Hi everyone!<br><br>Hope you all are doing well in this crazy pandemic - especially on AP/IB exams! Those of us who have already graduated from high school can't even imagine what doing those at this time would be like, so hats off to all of you in your endeavors and how you all are just killin' it! <br><br>We, the staff, would love to celebrate your achievements with a game night over Zoom after all exams have been completed! There will definitely be Jackbox Games (spanning all six party packs) and skribbl.io, but we will definitely be open to many other forms of online party games as well! Anyone is invited!<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Party Date and Time: May 29th, 2020, starting at 9 p.m. EST (6 p.m. PST)</strong> and there will be no definitive end time - everyone who attends is free to play games for as long as they want!<br><br><strong class="text-strong">Where:</strong> Use the chat function in the navigation bar above to join the Scioly.org IRC channel around the specified time, and the link to the Zoom call will be posted there at that time (You will not need an account to get into IRC! The only account you may need is one for Zoom, if you don't have one already <img class="smilies" src="https://scioly.org/forums/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" width="17" height="17" alt=":P" title="Razz">).<br><br>We understand that most of these games have player limits, but we plan to make sure everyone can rotate in and out regularly as players or as audience members and ensure maximum audience participation!<br><br>We hope to see you in a few weeks to destress after an exhausting end to this school year, and best of luck to everyone in what they have left to do!

Remember, it's okay not to be at your most productive during a pandemic.<br><br>As always, in the Scioly.org community we're here for one another, and we'll get through this together to see brighter times.

Beloved husband of Sharon; loving father of Michael (Connie) Putz of Menlo Park, California, Kevin (Michael McNamara) Putz of Evanston, Illinois, and Jenny (Bob) Kopach of Elmhurst, Illinois; cherished grandfather of Hannah Kopach, Johnny Kopach and Meera Putz; son of the late Leonita and Jacob Putz; brother of Jacob, Mary Agnes, Diana, Louis and Jeanette and the late David; uncle to precious nieces and nephews; friend to many around the world.<br><br>Dr. Putz founded the national Science Olympiad along with his wife Sharon and his educational partner, Jack Cairns of Delaware, in 1984, and grew it to one of the largest and most prestigious team science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) competitions in the country. Over the past 35 years, millions of students and teachers who have experienced Science Olympiad credit the program with launching their interest and careers in STEM. Dr. Putz obtained a bachelor's degree in Science from the University of Detroit, then served as an active duty officer in the US Army, later gaining a Master’s in Guidance and Counseling from Wayne State University, a Master’s in Arts and Liberal Sciences from Wesleyan University, and a Doctorate in Secondary Education from Wayne State University. He began his career teaching high school Biology, Chemistry, Earth Science and Special Ability Science Programs for the Detroit Public Schools in the 1960s, then served as the Macomb County Science Center Director and Coordinator of Gifted and Talented Programs at the Macomb Intermediate School District (MISD) in Mt. Clemens, Michigan for more than 30 years. Dr. Putz lectured at dozens of universities and has made more than 100 presentations at science education and gifted and talented conferences across the United States and in Japan. After serving in the Reserves for more than 20 years, Dr. Putz attained the rank of Lt. Colonel in the US Army Air Defense Artillery. He served on the boards of many non-profits, associations and community groups and was chosen as the National Outstanding Science Supervisor by the United States National Science Supervisors Association.<br>Gerard was an avid traveler, sports fanatic, outdoorsman and number one fan of his wife’s gourmet cooking. One of his favorite places on earth was Popham Beach, Maine, where he enjoyed some of his favorite things: lobster and drawn butter, fish chowder, bonfires, walks on the beach, cigars on the porch and a glass of Drambuie. He was a loving Gpa and Papa to Hannah, Johnny and Meera and took pride in their every accomplishment. Many people looked to Dr. Putz as a role model, leader and inspiration, and his wide influence in this world is likely immeasurable by any scientific method. Most of all, he was loved.<br><br>In lieu of flowers, memorials will be appreciated for a scholarship fund in Gerard’s name and may be sent to: Science Olympiad, Two Trans Am Plaza Drive, Suite 310, Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181.</div></blockquote><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=22093">bernard</a> — December 4th, 2019, 11:01 am — Replies 0 — Views 2169</p><hr />

Hello, and a Happy (Day After) Valentine's Day to all!<br><br>As some of you may know, last year we began allowing links to full test sets from previous seasons to be posted on the <a href="https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/2019_Test_Exchange#User-Submitted_Sets" class="postlink">wiki test exchange</a>, subject to a takedown policy. This was done as a response to changing demands for testing materials in the Science Olympiad community, done in a manner aligned with our values of providing open sharing of information to everyone. We are happy to report that since that time, the list of test sets has been maintained without incident. <br><br>Because of this, we are now allowing for <strong class="text-strong"><em class="text-italics">full test sets from the current 2018-19 season</em></strong> to be posted in <a href="https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/2019_Test_Exchange#2019_Season" class="postlink">the designated area on the wiki test exchange</a>. These tests will be held to a <em class="text-italics">very</em> strict takedown policy, whereby if any tournament or tournament director requests that the link is removed, the link will be taken down <em class="text-italics">immediately</em>, and that tournament's link will no longer be allowed to be added for the remainder of that season. Also note that this is a new step for the site, and if this turns out to cause problems, we may have to revert back to the previous setup.  However, it is our hope that some test sets will be allowed to remain on the list, for the betterment of the Science Olympiad community, and that this can create a robust bank of tests to be accessible by all teams.<br><br>Also, a brief reminder to all members that the Scioly.org Resource Policy (found on the site rules: <span style="text-transform:uppercase;font-family:'Avenir';font-weight:300;font-size:10px;color:#000"><a target="blank_" href="https://scioly.org/rules" rel="noreferrer">scioly.org/rules</a></span>) will still apply. Sharing of tests will still be restricted to Test Exchanges. A special reminder to everyone regarding Rule 2 of this Policy: <strong class="text-strong">No solicitation for test trades on any part of the Site, including the forums, chat, and wiki.</strong> This will continue to apply with the new exchange policy.<br><br>Thanks to all of our members; remember, it is your continued efforts and contributions that make this site great. Best of luck in your continued competitions!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11259">EastStroudsburg13</a> — February 15th, 2019, 5:59 am — Replies 54 — Views 6855</p><hr />

As a staff, we've noticed that users will sometimes have issues with account activation, mainly with not receiving the activation email. As a workaround, if you need to have your account activated, please go to <a href="https://scioly.org/chat" class="postlink">scioly.org/chat</a>, and you will be assisted by an administrator (Schrodingerscat, bernard, or myself). Please understand that our availability varies throughout the day/week, and if you do not find us on one day, please try again on a different day.<br><br>We will investigate other possible workarounds and will update this post if any of those are put into place.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="https://scioly.org/forums/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=11259">EastStroudsburg13</a> — November 20th, 2018, 6:44 am — Replies 0 — Views 2853</p><hr />
